# H1 Learning diary

# H2 Node.js

I was already familiar with Node.js from the Advance Web Applications course. However, the video was a good refresher, and I noticed I had forgotten some small things.

# H2 Express

I was already familiar with Express from the Advance Web Applications course. However, the video was a good refresher, and I noticed that I had forgotten some small things.

# H2 MongoDB

MongoDB was already familiar to me from the Advance Web Applications course. However, the video was a good refresher, and I noticed I had forgotten some small things. As a new thing, I learned how to use MongoDB CLI. Knowing how to use it will be helpful in the future.

# H2 Angular

Angular was entirely new for me, so I learned many new things. However, Angular is more confusing than React, so I will continue to use React in the future.

# H2 MEAN-stack

I think the project's idea was good; it presented a lot of useful things, but the videos' age completely ruined the joy for me. More than 80% of the time was spent solving problems caused by videos using methods that no longer work. I also found the Heroku part of the videos useful.

# H2 Project

As a project, I made a simple idea post wall. Anyone can write their thoughts on the wall so others can see them. Link to the video: https://lut-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/hannes_karppinen_student_lut_fi/EWTSgEDcj29JnLphnFnQoH8Ba5xZ57L8QyV6czNgQxrYwA?e=I45t7Q
